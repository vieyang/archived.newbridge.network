### Run website in this repo

NewBridge Network Website is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate static website.

All configs and settings files for Hugo are placed in `[.configs](./.configs)` directory. If you are familiar with Hugo, go into the directory and use it as any other Hugo project.

And for most people having `NPM` and `Yarn`, we added the hugo-bin and hugo-bin-extended to the Dev Dependencies. Use the following steps to run without install Hugo independently.

**Install Dependencies**

```bash
yarn
```

**Start Website in Dev Mode**

```bash
yarn dev
```
